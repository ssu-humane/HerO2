# Team HUMANE at AVeriTeC 2025: HerO 2 for Efficient Fact Verification

This repository provides the code for HerO 2, the runner-up for the AveriTeC shared task.

The system description paper will be published in the proceedings of the 8th FEVER workshop (co-located with ACL 2025)

# Method: HerO 2

- The above figure illustrates our system's inference pipeline. We configure four modules: evidence retrieval, question generation, answer reformulation and veracity prediction.
  + Evidence retrieval: We use [gte-base-en-v1.5](https://huggingface.co/Alibaba-NLP/gte-base-en-v1.5) for dense retrieval. To improve retrieval quality, we prompt an LLM to generate hypothetical fact-checking documents that expand the original query. Retrieved evidence candidates are summarized individually.
  + Question generation: We use an LLM to generate a verifying question for an document summary as answer candidate. 
  + Answer reformulation: We reformulate the summary into an answer format to align with the question.
  + Veracity prediction: We fully fine-tune and quantize an LLM to generate both justifications and verdicts.

# Veracity Prediction Model
The model checkpoints is available at Hugging Face Hub ðŸ¤—

We fine-tune a 32B model and apply quantization using AWQ.

- [humane-lab/Qwen3-32B-AWQ-HerO](https://huggingface.co/humane-lab/Qwen3-32B-AWQ-HerO) is our fine-tuned 32B model for veracity prediction and justification generation. We use Qwen3 32B for the base model.
